I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Toronto. I have a strong interest in cutting-edge AI technologies and enjoy applying AI-driven methods to improve efficiency and intelligence in real-world industrial systems. My experience spans both academic research and industry-oriented AI system development, with a focus on building practical, scalable solutions.

## Research Interests
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**: Cross-domain generalization, heterogeneous graph learning
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: LLM-enhanced systems, semantic alignment
- **AI Applications**: Social network analysis, computer vision, intelligent agents

## Current Focus
I am currently working on LLM-enhanced cross-domain graph neural networks, exploring how large language models can provide semantic priors to enable zero-shot generalization in heterogeneous graph structures. This work addresses the challenge of transferring GNN models across different domains without labeled data.

## Education
**University of Toronto** (Sep 2023 – Jun 2026)
Bachelor of Science, Computer Science + Statistics (Double Major)
GPA: 3.8 / 4.0

**Honors & Awards:**
- Dean's List Scholar (2024, 2025)
- Innis College Exceptional Achievement Award (2024)
- Meritorious Winner, Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (2021)

## Professional Experience
I have worked as an Algorithm Engineer at HuleTech (Prof. Yijie Peng's Group, Peking University) and as a Backend Developer at Tencent LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS, where I developed AI-powered systems and tools for real-world applications.
