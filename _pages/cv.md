* **Bachelor of Science**, Computer Science + Statistics (Double Major)
  * University of Toronto, Sep 2023 – Jun 2026 (Expected)
  * GPA: 3.8 / 4.0
  * **Selected Coursework**: Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Algorithm Design & Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Numerical Methods, Computer Organization
  * **Honors & Awards**:
    * Dean's List Scholar (2024, 2025)

Research Experience
======
* **LLM-Enhanced Cross-Domain Graph Neural Networks** (Jan 2025 – Oct 2025)
  * Conducted an in-depth literature review on cross-domain generalization in heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks, with a focus on semantic misalignment issues across domains.
  * Systematically studied representative methods including LLM-based test-time training (LLM-TTT), GraphCL, GraphPrompt, and zero-shot graph learning, summarizing their core ideas, assumptions, and limitations.
  * Analyzed how Large Language Models can be incorporated into graph learning pipelines as auxiliary semantic information, and examined their potential role in alleviating cross-domain representation gaps.
  * Participated in discussions and conceptual analysis of frameworks that combine textual descriptions with graph embeddings to support label-free or weakly supervised domain transfer.
  * Assisted in preliminary experimental exploration and result analysis to evaluate feature transfer behavior in unlabeled target domains.

* **Drug Trafficker Social Network Graph Construction & Analysis**
  * Built a large-scale heterogeneous social network dataset (7,000+ users, 45,000+ posts, 500+ keywords)
  * Developed Playwright-based crawlers to collect multi-layer social data beyond Twitter API limitations
  * Designed an LLM-assisted semi-automatic labeling workflow to reduce annotation cost
  * Implemented bidirectional edge construction using replies and retweets to improve graph completeness
  * Evaluated multiple baselines (GCN, GAT, HAN, HetGNN, HGAT) on node classification and relation prediction tasks
